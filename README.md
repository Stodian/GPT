# Typing Sound Application

## Overview
This application aims to provide a more interactive and engaging user experience by playing typing sounds as the application processes user input and a "bing" sound upon completion of the task. Ideal for chat applications, text editors, or any interface where text input and processing occur, it adds an auditory dimension to the digital interaction.

## Features
- **Typing Sound Feedback:** Continuous typing sound effects play when the application is processing input, simulating the sound of a keyboard to indicate that the process is ongoing.
- **Completion Notification:** A distinct "bing" sound notifies the user upon the successful completion of the input processing.
- **Customizable Sound Effects:** Users have the option to choose their preferred typing and notification sounds from a predefined list.
